Process
    Set Up Skeleton For Auth Service + Base Infra Setup (i.e. Skaffold & Ingress):
        - make auth directory and install base dependencies (with ts config file)
        - create dockerfile with instructions on building image

        - create auth deployment and auth service yaml file (deployment describes
        how to keep pods running, ClusterIP service enables internal network access)

        - create skaffold.yaml file to handle CI and sync updates from infra and src
        to cluster

        - create ingress-srv.yaml file in infra folder, which will create Ingress object 
        to handle routing web requests to running services (like auth or orders services)

        - write dummy test route in auth/src/index.ts to make sure that you have access to local
        cluster through Ingress nginx ('/api/users/current-user' route)
        - *manually change etc/hosts file so you can visit local version of ticketing.dev
        in your local browser (solely for development purposes!)
