Kubernetes:
    - a deployment is responsible for keeping a set of pods running
    - a service is responsible for enabling internal or external network access 
    to a set of pods
    - Skaffold: handles CI and applies updates to src and infra files to cluster

Skaffold:
    - deploy section describes where we should look for updates to deployments scripts
    - build section describes where to look for updates to src code
    - running skaffold dev runs skaffold file, which deploys everything in infra/k8s
    and watches for updates to those files + specified src files

Ingress NGINX:
    - Ingress Controller provides services for delivering and distributing client 
    web requests to Kubernetes cluster

Local Development Environment: equivalent of running all pods on our local machine

Google Cloud Development:
    - making changes to specifically synced files (i.e. the ones listed under sync in the
    skaffold file will automatically update the code in our pods)
    - making changes to non-synced files (e.g. package.json) will automatically tell Google
    Cloud Build to rebuild our docker image and update its deployment
